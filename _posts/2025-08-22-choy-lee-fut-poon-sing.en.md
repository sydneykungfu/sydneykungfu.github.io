**Poon Sing 師傅**, now around forty-eight years old, is of medium build, speaks with warmth and gentleness, courteous and earnest in his manners. Straightforward in character, unbound by trivial matters, he treats his disciples like his own children, guiding and instructing them with great care and patience, never neglecting any detail.

Influenced by his father since childhood, **Poon Sing 師傅** began learning martial arts at the age of seven. His father personally taught him the stance training of Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛, starting with the basic stance system known as *“Five Wheel Horse 五輪馬”*. After half a year of diligent practice, his foundation was deemed sufficient, and his father began teaching him the fundamental hand technique *“Che Kuen 扯拳”*.  

At that time, Japanese forces were heavily bombing Guangzhou, causing mass casualties. To escape the chaos, the Poon family relocated temporarily to Hong Kong, marking the first time **Poon Sing** came to the city, at age nine. During three years in Hong Kong, he continued training under his elder brother **Poon Co 潘楚**, reviewing and refining the Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 basics he had already learned.  

At twelve, his elder brother left for Zhao Guan National University, so he returned to Guangzhou to resume training with his father. At this stage, he began learning full sets of forms, starting with *“Sap Ji Kau Da Kuen 十字扣打拳.”*  

Two years later, his elder brother Poon departed to Kaiping for development, while **Poon Sing** remained in Guangzhou for school. After graduating from primary school at fifteen, he traveled alone to Zhaoqing to reunite with his father, living together for about eight months before enlisting in the military.  

He served in the Guangdong Pacification and Security Corps as a communications soldier. Stationed later in Guangxi, a frontline against Japanese forces, he often engaged in close combat. Thanks to his training in Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛, he repeatedly survived lethal encounters.  

One of the most intense battles occurred during a Japanese night raid: caught in sudden darkness and chaos, he was forced into bayonet combat. A charging Japanese soldier lunged at him, attempting a deadly thrust. Instinctively, he applied the Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 technique “Fung 封”, deflecting the attack, then followed up with stance and counterstrikes, killing the opponent on the spot. This demonstrated the speed, precision, and effectiveness of his martial training.

**Poon Sing 師傅** remained in military service until the Japanese surrender at age twenty, then returned to Guangzhou. By then, his father had earned significant prestige in the martial arts community, overseeing eight schools with over eight thousand disciples. These schools were jointly taught by **Poon Sing** and senior disciples such as Leung Sai 梁世, Chau Bing 周炳, and Chan Kai 陳啓.  

When the political situation changed on the mainland, **Poon Sing** followed his father in relocating to Hong Kong. During a period when his father taught in Fuk Wah Street, **Poon Sing** worked as the main instructor. After his father’s passing, he founded the *Poon Dik Athletic Association 潘狄體育會* in Causeway Bay in memory of him, serving as president. The association included basketball, soccer, music, and martial arts. In martial arts teaching, he was supported by his brother **Poon Co 潘楚**, Chau Bing 周炳, Leung Sai 梁世, and others.  

After three years in Causeway Bay, he relocated to Bark Yang Street, Kowloon, continuing his instruction. While his brother focused on soccer, **Poon Sing** devoted himself to promoting Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛. Thanks to his dedication, many disciples achieved success.

Among his prominent students was **Lee Koon Hung 李冠雄**, who later served as assistant instructor for several years, now chief instructor at another athletic association. Another disciple, **Wong Jung Gwai 黃仲貴**, emigrated to Canada, teaching privately with many students. In the United States, his grand-disciple **Kong Bak San 江北山** now runs more than ten martial arts schools.

In competitive martial arts, last year **Poon Sing** led disciples including **Lee Kin Sang 李健生**, **Jei Mun Yan 謝滿恩**, and others to Kuala Lumpur for the 3rd Southeast Asia Martial Arts Invitational Tournament. Lee Kin Sang 李健生 won second place in the middle division.  

Currently, several of his disciples serve as assistant instructors – Chong Yuen Jiu 鍾遠就, Jei Mun Yan 謝滿恩, Lam Gang Faat 林庚發 – teaching numerous students. **Poon Sing** also recently established a new medical clinic in Hung Hom, specializing in bone-setting and acupuncture, healing many patients, earning high praise in the community.

Regarding the principles of Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛, **Poon Sing** emphasizes unique insights. Beginners must relax their joints, not rely on brute force, but instead combine softness and fluid power with hard offense to overcome opponents. He particularly stresses energy circulation: when attacking with the right, the left remains relaxed yet ready to counter. This ability to mobilize both sides fluidly under pressure makes techniques an instinctive reaction, embodying true mastery.

His methods of instruction adapted to Hong Kong’s environment. Students first train in stance work and *Che Kuen 扯拳* for over a month, then progress to forms such as *Siu Ting Fa Kuen 小艇花拳*, *Sap Ji Kau Da Kuen 十字扣打拳*, and *Ping Jam Kuen 平踭拳*. After these basics, students may study weapons, first learning *Bin Gwaai Gun 法 扁拐棍*, then spear techniques. Alongside weapons, students also practice free sparring under **Poon Sing’s** supervision.  

In a demonstration, with disciple **Jei Mun Yan 謝滿恩**, he showcased various Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 sparring applications, which were photographed for reference, providing further insight into the style’s combat methods.

Now, besides teaching and healing, **Poon Sing** also serves as Vice Chairman of the Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 Founding Association (Chan Heung 陳享 General Association), Chief Martial Arts Instructor of the Hong Kong Five Elements Vendors’ Guild, and head of the On Bong Martial Arts Sports Department. Widely respected, he is recognized as both a guardian and promoter of Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 martial arts.
