## The Ideology of Choy Lee Fut Fist

Choy Lee Fut martial arts are broad and profound, ever-changing and full of vitality. Its greatest characteristic is being as still as a mountain and as dynamic as a flowing river. Movements are natural, open, and generous, attacking without leaving traces. In striking techniques, the main focus is on the “leak strike” method, meaning that under any circumstances, Choy Lee Fut striking techniques do not emphasize direct confrontation with the opponent. There is a saying in Choy Lee Fut: “Strike before the horse, the move is the strike, and the strike is the move.” This means that, unlike many other styles that stress using a specific move to counter another, Choy Lee Fut techniques are naturally expressed, resembling a wild wind blowing leaves, yet with order and discipline. The main goal is to attack any part of the opponent’s body, which is a unique style of Choy Lee Fut.

Although Choy Lee Fut does not have fixed moves for attacking the enemy, its unique techniques can be clearly applied in real combat. Every technique in Choy Lee Fut has its own unique style and independent potential. However, there is a very close connection between each scattered move. In actual combat, when any move is combined with another, it forms a clear yin-yang cycle, making it difficult for the opponent to predict the continuous changes. Amidst endless variations, the main purpose is to attack the opponent, but this also includes the different methods of force, stance, body, waist, hand, and foot, aiming to achieve unity of offense and defense. Choy Lee Fut is practiced in a continuous yin-yang transformation, with the saying: “Yin is defense, yang is attack; yang is defense, yin is attack.” Sometimes, it is even reversed: “Yang is attack, yin is also attack; yang is defense, yin is also defense.” Nevertheless, Choy Lee Fut techniques always strive to maintain the principle of “defense through offense” as much as possible. Although in countless routines, people may see fixed forms of Choy Lee Fut striking techniques with both offense and defense, this is only for practitioners to understand the forms during training and to recognize various stances and body shapes, which serve as the foundation for future real combat.

Because Choy Lee Fut often uses continuous attacks in real combat, regular practice of routines establishes a solid foundation, as each set contains training for continuous attacks. To cope with different combat situations, Choy Lee Fut has many routines, but the techniques are mainly based on the “Ten Methods” (Kam (擒), Naa (拿), Gwaa (掛), Sau (掃), Chaap (插), Paau (拋), Caap (扱), Biu (標), Ding (頂), Zong (撞)) that are continuously connected and interrelated. Even the most basic set is a transformation of the Ten Methods. From simple to complex, at every stage, the goal is to master the Ten Methods more proficiently and reach perfection. The Ten Methods can be said to be the core of Choy Lee Fut.

## The Significance of Fist Movement

Choy Lee Fut striking techniques, like many sports, bring physical and mental joy and help achieve the goal of physical fitness. However, many sports only focus on partial training, and some neglect the coordination of breathing, which can lead to adverse effects on health. Of course, if normal physical exercises are done under the guidance of an instructor, there will be no negative effects, but the benefits are still limited to physical training. Practicing Choy Lee Fut striking techniques not only strengthens the body but also contains profound and subtle self-defense principles. In Choy Lee Fut, besides the continuous movement of the body, waist, steps, and stances for overall training, there are also combinations of techniques such as Kam (擒), Naa (拿), Gwaa (掛), Sau (掃), Chaap (插), Paau (拋), Caap (扱), Biu (標), Ding (頂), Zong (撞), and others. However, in Choy Lee Fut, practical fist techniques are mainly based on the Ten Methods, while other techniques and movements are considered secondary in attacking the opponent. Techniques like “Pun Kiu(蟠 橋),” “Cyun Kiu(穿 橋),” “Laap Sau (擸⼿),” “Pak Sau (拍 ⼿), ” “Lyut Jik Sau(掠 翼 ⼿), ” "Kam Sau (冚 ⼿)" etc., cannot be regarded as the main killing moves. Of course, at the right time, these techniques can assist the Ten Methods or independently serve as practical self-defense and effective attacking techniques.
