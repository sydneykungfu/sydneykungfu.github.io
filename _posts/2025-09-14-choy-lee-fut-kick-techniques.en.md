Kicking techniques hold a very important place in every martial arts school, especially in Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛, where kicks are considered an advanced academic subject. Over a hundred years ago, Choy Lee Fut treated kicks as secret techniques. Unless a disciple was favored by the master and had a solid foundation, it was not easy to learn or even see the school's kicking methods. Even if one had the chance to learn these secrets, strict discipline was required, and techniques could not be shown casually. To this day, many in the martial arts world still do not fully understand Choy Lee Fut kicks, and there is a misconception that Choy Lee Fut focuses only on hand techniques and is not skilled in kicks. This is completely incorrect. In fact, kicks are the most valued techniques in Choy Lee Fut, and the pursuit of mastery in kicks is a lifelong goal for many practitioners.

Choy Lee Fut 蔡李佛 kicking techniques include gou (勾), daan (彈), dang (蹬), caang (撑), tek (踢), liu (撩), caan (鏟), ding (釘), cin (纏), ziu (跺), gwaa (掛), baai (擺), saau (掃), zau (揪), etc. Each term represents a type of kick, each with its own unique characteristics and profound subtleties. Whether in combat or practice, Choy Lee Fut kicks are as graceful as a dance. However, in actual combat, Choy Lee Fut kicks are extremely fierce and ruthless. Therefore, in general situations, practitioners rarely use kicks against opponents, preferring hand techniques. Only when facing strong opponents are kicks employed. Kicks are not simply learned and then useful; they require arduous training. The process is complex, often involving muk yan jong 木人樁 (wooden dummy), sandbag kicking, and, most importantly, attention to angles and partner sparring.

## zak caang goek 側撐腳 (Side Thrust Kick)
caang goek 撐腳 includes zak caang goek 側撐腳 and ngo caang goek 臥撐腳, both distinctive. In Choy Lee Fut, the more common is the side body collision kick, also known as "帶馬歸糟". ngo caang goek 臥撐腳 is harder to practice and more dangerous in combat, requiring high skill, alertness, agility, and composure. Thus, ngo caang goek is rarely seen.

Fig 3: As the opponent's body is unsettled, the right quickly uses the front leg in a horizontal thrust towards the opponent's waist and ribs, focusing power in the front leg.

## gwaa mei goek 掛眉腳 (Hanging Eyebrow Kick)
gwaa mei goek is a high stance kick, difficult to practice and dangerous to use. The kick must be ruthless, accurate, and fast to be effective and safe. In combat, it targets the opponent's "tai yang穴" (temple). Though dangerous, it is eye-catching and elegant from any angle.

## zik dang goek 直蹬腳 (Straight Thrust Kick)
zik dang goek is a powerful attacking kick, suitable for both side and close range. It is often used when the opponent suddenly attacks, allowing for a quick thrust. The technique is close-range, so flexibility is important in training.

## liu jam goek 撩陰腳 (Groin Flick Kick)
liu jam goek is a fast and vicious kick, always assisted by hand techniques. It is not an active attack but a semi-passive counter, targeting the opponent's groin, the most vulnerable part of the body. If hit, it can cause serious injury, so it is rarely used.

## soeng fei goek 雙飛腳 (Double Flying Kick)
soeng fei goek is well-known in all schools, but its real application is often exaggerated in novels and movies. Many imagine both legs kicking simultaneously like an eagle flying, but in reality, its effectiveness depends on training and talent. In Choy Lee Fut, soeng fei goek is difficult but common, and most practitioners have trained it. It is also called lin waan goek 連環腳 (continuous kick), used to attack high, middle, and low targets in succession, making it hard to defend. When using soeng fei goek, first use shadow hand to distract, then use a light kick to the middle or lower part, followed by a heavy kick to a vital area. The timing is close, so it appears as a double kick.
