  <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-6">
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Origin of the Choy Lee Fut Lineage</h1>
    <p class="text-sm mb-2">Excerpt from the 86th Anniversary Special Issue of the Hong Kong Chin Woo Athletic Association</p>
    <p class="text-sm mb-8">Translated by Sifu Angus on Apirl 2025</p>
    <p class="mb-8">
      Choy Lee Fut (蔡李佛) has a history spanning over 170 years since its founding. Many often ask, “What is Choy Lee Fut?” Though it originates from a long and distant past, the answer is quite straightforward. Choy Lee Fut is a martial art system that combines the secret techniques of three styles: Choy Family Fist (蔡家拳), Lee Family Kicks (李家腳), and Buddhist Palm (佛家掌). These three styles were blended and unified into a single comprehensive system known as Choy Lee Fut (蔡李佛).
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
      According to legend, Choy Family Fist was taught to the founder Chen Heung (陳享) by Choy Fook (蔡福), a Shaolin monk. Later, a man named Cheung Hung Sing (張亞炎)—born with great strength and passionate about martial arts—sought to learn from Chen Heung. His father was acquainted with Chen and took him to Chen Village (陳村) to request martial training. However, the village had a tradition of not accepting disciples with a different surname. Unable to enroll formally, Cheung Hung Sing took up general labor work in the village. Every time Chen Heung taught martial arts, Cheung would eavesdrop and memorize the techniques. At night, he practiced them in secret.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
      Eventually, the local disciples discovered this and challenged him to a match. To their surprise, Cheung Hung Sing defeated all of them. They complained to the village elders, accusing Chen Heung of secretly teaching Cheung. Chen, having no choice, had to send Cheung away. Before parting, he advised Cheung to seek out Monk Green Grass (青草和尚) at Bapai Mountain (八排山).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Monk Green Grass was a master of Buddhist Palm (佛家掌). Cheung stayed in the mountains for eight years, receiving the monk’s full teachings. 
      Afterward, he returned to Foshan (佛山) and established the Hung Sing Martial Arts School (鴻勝館)—thus earning the name Cheung Hung Sing (張鴻勝). 
      After mastering Buddhist Palm, Cheung returned to Chen Village to report his progress to his teacher Chen Heung.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-6">
      Another key figure was Lee Yau San (李友山), a Shaolin disciple highly skilled in leg techniques, later known for Lee Family Kicks (李家腳).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      At the time, Chen Heung, Lee Yau San, and Cheung Hung Sing were all anti-Qing patriots fighting to restore the Ming dynasty. Each had revolutionary duties and would eventually go their separate ways. Before parting, they decided to pool all their martial knowledge together, exchanging techniques and integrating their styles into a new, unified system—thus giving birth to Choy Lee Fut (蔡李佛). This legacy continues to be passed down to this day.</p>
