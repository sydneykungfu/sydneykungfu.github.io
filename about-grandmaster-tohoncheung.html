        <p class="text-sm mb-2">Written by Chu Shiu Ki, 1970s Choy Lee Fut Magazine, Volume 1</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-8">Translated by Sifu Angus on July 2025</p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
            Mr. To Hon Cheung, originally from Gaoyao County in Guangdong Province, 
            was highly skilled in both medicine and martial arts. 
            He was a formal disciple of the renowned Choy Lee Fut master, 
            <a href="about-grandmaster-fongyukshu.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">Fong Yuk Shu (ÊñπÁéâÊõ∏)</a>, 
            in Hong Kong (È¶ôÊ∏Ø) and GuangdongÔºàÂª£Êù±Ôºâ. 
            Having received the complete and authentic transmission of his master‚Äôs secret techniques, 
            he shared close ties with Master Chan Hon Hung, who was both a fellow townsman and martial brother. 
            Together, they not only trained in martial arts but also collaborated closely in the study and advancement of Chinese traumatology (Dit Da medicine), 
            forming a deep mutual respect and bond.

            Grandmaster To Hon Cheung
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
            In his early years, Master To established martial arts schools in Qingyuan and Guangzhou, 
            gaining a strong reputation for his martial and medical expertise. 
            After moving to Hong Kong, he founded the To Hon Cheung Martial Arts and Health 
            Institute at 295 Yu Chau Street, 2nd Floor, Sham Shui Po. There, he dedicated himself 
            to promoting the Choy Li Fut martial art and practicing comprehensive Chinese medicine, 
            especially in traumatology. Many of his students‚Äîincluding <a href="about-grandmaster-chushiuki.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">Chu Shiu Ki (Êú±ÂÖÜÂü∫)</a>, Ng Bing Keung, 
            Chan Ming, Ko Choi, and Lo Ching‚Äîwent on to establish their own schools and pass on his teachings.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
            His son, To Sam ÔºàÊùúÊ∑±Ôºâ, began training in martial arts at a young age and 
            also inherited his father‚Äôs medical knowledge. In pursuit of deeper learning, 
            he furthered his studies at Tsinghua University‚Äôs School of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 
            Upon graduation, he assisted in managing both the medical practice and martial arts instruction. 
            Despite his youth, he has proven himself to be a capable successor‚Äîtruly a 
            ‚Äútiger father begets no weak son.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
            Throughout his life, Master To was known for his chivalrous spirit, 
            strong sense of justice, and charitable heart. Beyond promoting traditional 
            martial arts and using medicine to heal the public, he was actively involved in social 
            welfare and charitable endeavors. He served as a medical consultant for traumatology across 
            numerous major industrial and commercial associations in Hong Kong and Kowloon.
